# mikera-clojure

A library of general purpose Clojure utilities and experimental code by Mike

Not really intended for public consumption, though it is all LGPL licensed in case someone wants to borrow anything useful :-)

Particularly useful and more actively maintained stuff will graduate into the clojure-utils library:
