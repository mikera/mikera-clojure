# mikera-clojure

A library of general purpose Clojure utilities and experimental code by Mike

Not really intended for public consumption, but all LGPL licensed in case someone wants to borrow anything useful :-)

Particularly useful and maintained stuff will graduate into the clojure-utils library:
